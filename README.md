# Odin Recipes: Purpose
This is my first project for The Odin Project. It demonstrates my foundational knowledge of HTML5 through building a simple multi-page recipe website. The goal is to gain hands-on experience with structuring HTML documents, using links for navigation, and organizing content effectively.

## Assignment Overview
This project was broken down into several iterations:

### Iteration 1: Basic Structure
Created an index.html homepage within the odin-recipes/ directory.

Added standard HTML5 boilerplate and an <h1> heading titled "Odin Recipes".

### Iteration 2: First Recipe Page
Created a recipes/ subdirectory.

Added a new HTML file (e.g., lasagna.html) for my first recipe.

Included a link from index.html to this new recipe page and a link back for navigation.

### Iteration 3: Recipe Page Content
Each recipe page includes:

An image of the finished dish.

A short description of the recipe.

An Ingredients section with an unordered list.

A Steps section with an ordered list.

### Iteration 4: Adding More Recipes
Added two additional recipes with the same structure.

Updated the index.html page to list all recipe links in an unordered list.

## Features
- Simple HTML-only website — no CSS or JavaScript (yet).
- Contains three of my mom’s Christmas recipes.
- Fully navigable structure with semantic HTML tags.

# A Letter to Me
I originally learned web design back in high school (2009–2012) and was top of my class. I loved it — but life had other plans. Now, in 2025, I'm relearning these skills and finally pursuing the career I once dreamed about.

Today is 07/23/2025, and I’m still working a job in insurance that no longer brings me joy. I’ve spent 8 years at an agency now run by a man whose values don’t align with mine. I’m putting in the work now so that I can one day hand in a very cathartic resignation letter.

 ## My Future Resignation Letter
 Dearest Bossman,

Love,

(P.S. if you're a future employer reading this, I'm totally joking! …Kind of.)
